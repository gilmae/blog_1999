                  <p>I don't have a P3P policy thing, mainly because I don't care enough to write one up formally. They're a glorified version of the privacy policies that have been around for as long as e-commerce. Privacy policies are vapor, so I refuse to engage in them.</p>
                  <p>What I will do is tell you what personal infomation gets collected by this site and how it is used.</p>
                  <p>When you submit a comment, the system searches for the name you supplied, and if it can't find it, it will create an entry in the database storing the name, email and url you supplied. It uses these to identify the author of the comment you made to future readers. If at some point you decide you want your email or url changed, contact me, because this is doable.</p>
                  <p>I won't delete comments though. For technical reasons, it is a massive pain in the arse, and for personal reasons, in my thinking, if you said it, you said it.<p>
                  <p>The site makes use of cookies. If you do not know what a cookie is, essentially it is a small file web sites write to your own machine to customise the site for you. For example, The New York Times uses them to provide you with categories of news you have requested.</p>
                  <p>In this case, the cookie stores some or all of the following, depending on circumstances.</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li><span class="bold">name, url, email</span>: If you have written a comment, and opted to have the site remember your name and email and url, these three entries will appear in the cookie.</li>
                     <li><span class="bold">collapsible, nesting, maxLevel, minLevel</span>: If you have changed the display variables while reading threads and opted for the site to remember your preferences, these four entries will appear in the cookie.</li>
                     <li><span class="bold">dateLastLogged</span>: dateLastLogged is the date and time you last opened the site. It is used to notify you what threads have been updated since the last time you visited.</li>
                     <li><span class="bold">dateLastHere</span>: dateLastHere is a temporary entry, meaning it only exists while you have the site open in your browser. It is the next to last time you visited the site. It is used in conjunction with dateLastLogged to display new comments and entries, and updated threads.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>I won't track what you do here, because I don't care. I won't sell your email address to marketers, because I make enough money as is, thanks. Your url is never outputted to screen, instead, the site uses redirects, so don't bother commenting if you just want to up your google ranking.</p>
