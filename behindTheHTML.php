                  <p>Avocadia is the personal page of me. All opinions expressed within are valid
                     in my reality.</p>
                  <p>Code base is currently at version 0.4 which is pretty relevant, as far as arbitrary
                     numbers goes.</p>
                  <p>The site was created using TextPad 4.0</p>
                  <p>It is written in XHTML 1.1 Strict and CSS 2. Every now and then I go and see if they validate and then fix the minor bugs that have crept in due to incremental changes. So any any given point, the site more or less validates. Probably not stable enough for me to go get the merit badges though.</p>
                  <p>Reading of external RSS feeds facilitated by <a href="class.RSS.php.txt" title="class.RSS.php">class.RSS.php</a>. Blo.gs pings facilitated by <a href="weblogscom.inc.txt" title="weblogscom.inc">weblogscom.inc</a>. Under the terms of the GPL I am probably supposed to expose my own code due to my use of those two GPLed modules, but the code for avocadia is immature, so I won't. So there.</p>
