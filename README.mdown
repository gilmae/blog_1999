# An old custom blooging engine
As near as I can tell, this is the code I used to blog with from about 1999-2006.

I've made some minor edits to get parts of it to work (possibly all of it) with PHP7, but aside from that it's as it was.

I've uploaded this more for my own curiosity than anything else.
